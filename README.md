This project is an implementation of the Banker's algorithm, a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm, using Android Studio and Java. 
The application allows the user to input the number of processes, resources, and their respective allocation and maximum matrices. 
Based on this input, the algorithm determines whether the system is in a safe state or not. 
The implementation is done using vector data structures to hold the input data and perform the necessary calculations. 
The application features an easy-to-use interface and provides feedback to the user on whether the input is valid or not. 
The project can be useful for students studying operating systems or anyone interested in understanding the Banker's algorithm.
